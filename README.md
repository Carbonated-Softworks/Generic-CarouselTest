# Generic-CarouselTest
Publicis.Sapient Senior Front End Test

I was unable to get around to adding unit tests as I spent a large amount of time ensuring multi browser compatibility, given more time I would have liked to add unit tests for the following (Using Jest and Enzyme)

  Card selection logic
  Bezier curve checks
  react render order
  dynamic screen scale checks
  
There may be more that requires testing, and in the event of being given more time I would try to emphasise the inclusion of more checks than the opnes I previously listed.
